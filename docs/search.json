    "text": "COLORADO-BASED ARTIST / ILLUSTRATOR\nI wish I could say that I’ve finely-tuned one medium, one mode of creating art — But that would be untrue to myself. I create wherever inspiration strikes, in whatever form I feel most drawn to. I primarily focus on illustration (both on paper and digitally), but dabble in sculpting, jewelry-making, painting, collage making, and photography. The joy of creating is in exploration, which is why I’m hesitant to tether myself to one medium.\n\n\nWant to create together or commission a personalized art piece?
