## Future Projects

::: callout-important
The creative process isn't linear. These ideas are always subject to change, but they serve as ideas I'm currently interested in or as inspiration for future commissions!
:::

-   Fantasy character design (specifically for DND campaigns)

-   Canvas & acrylic pet portraits, especially of dogs

-   Hand-bleached t-shirt designs

-   "Shag" inspired, mid-modern digital art
